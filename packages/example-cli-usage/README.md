# example cli usage

This example demonstrates how to use cssnano with postcss-cli. You can copy
the source files to get a simple example of how it works!

To run the script, make sure that you have the appropriate dependencies
using `npm install`, and then you can run this script via the command line:

    npm run minify

That's it! You should now see a file named `output.css` in the directory with
your minified styles.
