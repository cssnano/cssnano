cssnano is a MIT licensed open source project and therefore completely free
to use; however development of new features & ongoing maintenance work is not
sustainable without financial backing. Please help us to stay independent and
support us!

You can support us through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/beneb) as an
ongoing commitment, or one-time through [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/benebinfo).
