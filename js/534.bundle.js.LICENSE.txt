 * @overview
 *
 * This default preset for cssnano only includes transforms that make no
 * assumptions about your CSS other than what is passed in. In previous
 * iterations of cssnano, assumptions were made about your CSS which caused
 * output to look different in certain use cases, but not others. These
 * transforms have been moved from the defaults to other presets, to make
 * this preset require only minimal configuration.
